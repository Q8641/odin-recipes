      <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Cook the Spaghetti : </strong>
           <div>Boil the spaghetti in a large pot of salted water until al dente. Reserve a cup of
             pasta water, then drain the spaghetti.</div></li>
      <li><strong>Infuse the Olive Oil : </strong>
            <div>In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the sliced garlic and 
            red pepper flakes, saut√©ing until the garlic is golden but not browned. Adjust the
             heat to prevent burning.</div></li>
      <li><strong>Toss the Pasta : </strong><div>Add the drained spaghetti to the skillet, tossing
             to coat each strand in the garlic-infused oil. If needed, add a bit of the reserved
              pasta water to achieve the desired consistency.</div></li>
      <li><strong>Season to Perfection : </strong><div>Season the pasta with salt and black pepper to
             taste. Continue tossing until the spaghetti is well-coated and infused with the flavors
              of garlic and red pepper.</div></li>
      <li><strong>Garnish and Serve : </strong><div>Transfer the spaghetti to serving plates, garnishing
             with fresh chopped parsley. Finish with a generous sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese for
              an extra layer of savory goodness.</div></li>
      <li><strong> Enjoy the Simplicity! </strong><div>Serve immediately and savor the simplicity of this
             Classic Spaghetti Aglio e Olio. Pair it with a crisp white wine, and revel in the delightful
              combination of garlic, olive oil, and a hint of heat. Mangia bene!</div></li>
