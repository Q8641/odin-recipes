      <li>1 can (28  ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 cans (6 ounces each) tomato paste</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes(optional)</li>
      <li>12 lasagna noodles, cooked al dente</li>
      <li>4 cups shredded mozarella cheese</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li><strong>Bechamel sauce :</strong></li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Brown the meat : </strong>In a large skillet over medium heat,
          brown the groundbeef and Italian sausage until fully cooked. Add chopped
          onions and minced garlic, sautéing until the onions are 
          translucent.</li>
          
      <li><strong>Create the Tomato sauce : </strong> in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, basil, oregano, salt, 
        black pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Simmer the sauce for 30 minutes,
         allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>

      <li><strong>Prepare the Bechamel Sauce : </strong>In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add flour,
         whisking continuously to create a roux. Gradually pour in the milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Add salt
          and nutmeg, simmering until the sauce thickens. Remove from heat.</li>
      <li><strong>Assemble the layers : </strong>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). In a large baking dish, spread a thin
         layer of meat sauce. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top. Add a generous portion of meat sauce, followed
          by a layer of béchamel sauce and a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Repeat the layers, finishing with a
           cheese topping.</li>
      <li><strong> Bake to Perfection : </strong>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
         Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>

      <li><strong>Let it rest : </strong>Allow the lasagna to cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set,
         ensuring each serving is a perfect blend of flavors and textures.</li>

      <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy! </strong>Cut generous portions of this Hearty Homestyle Lasagna and serve with a sprinkle of 
        fresh basil or parsley. Pair with a side salad and your favorite red wine for an unforgettable dining experience. Buon appetito!</li>
